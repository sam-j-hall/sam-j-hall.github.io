abstract: The performance of graphene-based (opto)electronic devices depends critically
  on the graphene/metal interface formed at the metal contacts. We show here that
  the interface properties may be controlled by topological defects, such as the pentagon–heptagon
  (5–7) pairs, because of their strongly enhanced bonding to the metal. To measure
  the bond energy and other key properties not accessible for the embedded defects,
  we use azulene as a molecular model for the 5–7 defect. Comparison to its isomer
  naphthalene, which represents the regular graphene structure, reveals that azulene
  interacts more strongly with a Pt(111) surface. Its adsorption energy, as measured
  by single-crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC), exceeds that of naphthalene by
  up to 116 kJ/mol (or up to 50%). Both isomers undergo hybridization of their frontier
  orbitals with metal states, as indicated by X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron
  spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy
  combined with molecular orbital (MO) projection analysis through dispersion-corrected,
  periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on the NEXAFS/DFT analysis,
  the stronger bond of the 5–7 system is attributed to the different energetic response
  of its unoccupied frontier orbitals to adsorption. Adsorption-induced bond-length
  changes show substantial topology-related differences between the isomers. Electron
  transfer occurs in both directions through donation/back-donation, resulting in
  the partial occupation (deoccupation) of formerly unoccupied (occupied) orbitals,
  as revealed by periodic energy decomposition analysis (pEDA) for extended systems.
  Our model study shows that the topology of the π-electron system strongly affects
  its bonding to a transition metal and thus can be utilized to tailor interface properties.
