abstract: First principles simulation of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is
  an important tool in the challenging interpretation and assignment of XPS data of
  metal-organic interfaces. We investigate the origin of the disagreement between
  XPS simulation and experiment for the azulene molecule adsorbed on Ag(111). We systematically
  eliminate possible causes for this discrepancy, including errors in the structural
  model and finite size effects in periodic boundary conditions. By analysis of the
  electronic structure in the ground-state and the core-hole excited-state, we are
  able to trace the error back to artificial charge transfer between adsorbed molecule
  and metal surface. This is caused by the self-interaction error of common exchange-correlation
  functionals. This error is not remedied by standard hybrid or range-separated hybrid
  functionals. We employ an ad hoc self-interaction error correction based on molecular
  orbital projection, that exposes this issue and is able to recover the correct experimental
  behaviour. The charge transfer artefact also negatively affects the prediction of
  X-ray absorption spectra for this system. Both the simulated photoemisson and x-ray
  absorption spectra show a better agreement with experimental data, once the ad hoc
  correction is employed. Similar core-hole-induced charge artefacts may affect core-level
  simulations at metal-organic interfaces more generally.
