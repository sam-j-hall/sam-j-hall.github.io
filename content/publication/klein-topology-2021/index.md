abstract: Pyrene derivatives play a prominent role in organic electronic devices,
  including field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. The
  flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation
  of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence
  of the topology of the central π-electron system on the relevant properties such
  as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this
  work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a π-electron
  system with non-alternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge
  X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that
  the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene.
  The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined
  by ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy. The non-alternant nature of azupyrene
  is also associated with a more localized charge distribution. Further insight is
  provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties
  and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions. The concept
  of aromaticity is used to interpret the major topology-related differences.
