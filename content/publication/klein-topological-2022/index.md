abstract: Defects play a critical role for the functionality and performance of materials,
  but the understanding of the related effects is often lacking, because the typically
  low concentrations of defects make them difficult to study. A prominent case is
  the topological defects in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. The performance
  of graphene-based (opto-)electronic devices depends critically on the properties
  of the graphene/metal interfaces at the contacting electrodes. The question of how
  these interface properties depend on the ubiquitous topological defects in graphene
  is of high practical relevance, but could not be answered so far. Here, we focus
  on the prototypical Stone–Wales (S–W) topological defect and combine theoretical
  analysis with experimental investigations of molecular model systems. We show that
  the embedded defects undergo enhanced bonding and electron transfer with a copper
  surface, compared to regular graphene. These findings are experimentally corroborated
  using molecular models, where azupyrene mimics the S–W defect, while its isomer
  pyrene represents the ideal graphene structure. Experimental interaction energies,
  electronic-structure analysis, and adsorption distance differences confirm the defect-controlled
  bonding quantitatively. Our study reveals the important role of defects for the
  electronic coupling at graphene/metal interfaces and suggests that topological defect
  engineering can be used for performance control.
