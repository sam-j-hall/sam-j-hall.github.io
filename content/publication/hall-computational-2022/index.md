abstract: Molecules adsorbed onto metal surfaces, especially carbon-based aromatic
  molecules, can provide systems that offer tunable properties and can be used in
  organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). It is important to understand the behaviour
  of these systems at a molecular level in order to rationally engineer interfaces
  with specific properties. Core-level spectroscopy can provide a beneficial method
  to probe aspects of molecule-metal interfaces such as geometrical structure, stability,
  chemical bonding and electronic structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
  and near-edge absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy can be used in tandem
  to gain significant insight into the studied system. However, the resulting spectra
  from these techniques can often prove hard to fully analyse as they contain multiple
  close-lying features and loss of clarity from broadening. This is where simulations
  of spectra can come in to help to disentangle and interpret spectra. This thesis
  establishes practical simulation workflows to predict XPS and NEXAFS spectra of
  metal-organic interfaces based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). These methods
  are applied to study the adsorption of aromatic adsorbates on metal surfaces, two-dimensional
  networks, and an oxidised diamond surface. As part of this work, the assessment
  of the performance and accuracy of simulations against experiment was carried out.
  Core-level simulations on various systems were performed to rationalise experimental
  findings on structure, stability, and surface chemical bonding.
