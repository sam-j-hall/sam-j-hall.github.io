abstract: X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are important techniques
  to characterize chemical bonding at surfaces and are often used to identify the
  strength and nature of adsorbate–substrate interactions. In this study, we judge
  the ability of X-ray spectroscopic techniques to identify different regimes of chemical
  bonding at metal–organic interfaces. To achieve this, we sample different interaction
  strength regimes in a comprehensive and systematic way by comparing two topological
  isomers, azulene and naphthalene, adsorbed on three metal substrates with varying
  reactivity, namely the (111) facets of Ag, Cu, and Pt. Using density functional
  theory, we simulate core-level binding energies and X-ray absorption spectra of
  the molecular carbon species. The simulated spectra reveal three distinct characteristics
  based on the molecule-specific spectral features which we attribute to types of
  surface chemical bonding with varying strength. We find that weak physisorption
  only leads to minor changes compared to the gas-phase spectra, weak chemisorption
  leads to charge transfer and significant spectral changes, and strong chemisorption
  leads to a loss of the molecule-specific features in the spectra. The classification
  we provide is aimed at assisting interpretation of experimental X-ray spectra for
  complex metal–organic interfaces.
