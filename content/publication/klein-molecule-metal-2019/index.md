abstract: Interfaces between polycyclic π-electron systems and metals play prominent
  roles in organic or graphene-based (opto)electronic devices, in which performance-related
  parameters depend critically on the properties of metal/semiconductor contacts.
  Here, we explore how the topology of the π-electron system influences the bonding
  and the electronic properties of the interface. We use azulene as a model for nonalternant
  pentagon–heptagon (5–7) ring pairs and compare it to its isomer naphthalene, which
  represents the alternant 6–6 ring pair. Their coverage-dependent interaction with
  Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces was studied with the normal-incidence X-ray standing
  wave (NIXSW) technique, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy,
  UV and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (UPS and XPS), and density functional
  theory (DFT). Coverage-dependent adsorption heights and spectroscopic data reveal
  that azulene forms shorter interfacial bonds than naphthalene and engages in stronger
  electronic interactions with both surfaces. These differences are more pronounced
  on Cu. Increasing coverages lead to larger adsorption heights, indicating bond weakening
  by intermolecular repulsion. The extensive DFT calculations include dispersive interactions
  using (1) the DFT-D3 scheme, (2) the vdWsurf correction based on DFT-TS, (3) a many-body
  dispersion (MBD) correction scheme, and (4) the D3surf scheme. All methods predict
  the adsorption heights reasonably well with an average error below 0.1 Å. The stronger
  bond of azulene is attributed to its nonalternant topology, which results in a reduced
  highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
  gap and brings the LUMO energetically close to the Fermi energy of the metal, causing
  stronger hybridization with electronic states of the metal surfaces.
