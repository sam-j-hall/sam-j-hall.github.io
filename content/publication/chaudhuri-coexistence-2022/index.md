abstract: Diamond-based materials have unique properties that are exploited in many
  electrochemical, optical, thermal, and quantum applications. When grown via chemical
  vapor deposition (CVD), the growth rate of the (110) face is typically much faster
  than the other two dominant crystallographic orientations, (111) and (100). As such,
  achieving sufficiently large-area and high-quality (110)-oriented crystals is challenging
  and typically requires post-growth processing of the surface. Whilst CVD growth
  confers hydrogen terminations on the diamond surface, the majority of post-growth
  processing procedures render the surface oxygen-terminated, which in turn impacts
  the surface properties of the material. Here, we determine the oxygenation state
  of the (110) surface using a combination of density functional theory calculations
  and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. We show that in the 0–1000 K temperature
  range, the phase diagram of the (110) surface is dominated by a highly stable phase
  of coexisting and adjacent carbonyl and ether groups, while the stability of peroxide
  groups increases at low temperatures and high pressures. We propose a mechanism
  for the formation of the hybrid carbonyl-ether phase and rationalize its high stability.
  We further corroborate our findings by comparing simulated core-level binding energies
  with experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data on the highest-quality (110)-oriented
  diamond crystal surface reported to date.
