abstract: X-ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure
  (NEXAFS) spectroscopy play an important role in investigating the structure and
  electronic structure of materials and surfaces. Ab initio simulations provide crucial
  support for the interpretation of complex spectra containing overlapping signatures.
  Approximate core-hole simulation methods based on density functional theory (DFT)
  such as the delta-self-consistent-field (ΔSCF) method or the transition potential
  (TP) method are widely used to predict K-shell XPS and NEXAFS signatures of organic
  molecules, inorganic materials and metal-organic interfaces at reliable accuracy
  and affordable computational cost. We present the numerical and technical details
  of our variants of the ΔSCF and TP method (coined ΔIP-TP) to simulate XPS and NEXAFS
  transitions. Using exemplary molecules in gas-phase, in bulk crystals, and at metal-organic
  interfaces, we systematically assess how practical simulation choices affect the
  stability and accuracy of simulations. These include the choice of exchange-correlation
  functional, basis set, the method of core-hole localization, and the use of periodic
  boundary conditions (PBC). We particularly focus on the choice of aperiodic or periodic
  description of systems and how spurious charge effects in periodic calculations
  affect the simulation outcomes. For the benefit of practitioners in the field, we
  discuss sensible default choices, limitations of the methods, and future prospects.
