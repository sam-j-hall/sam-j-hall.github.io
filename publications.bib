	abstract = {X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are important techniques to characterize chemical bonding at surfaces and are often used to identify the strength and nature of adsorbate–substrate interactions. In this study, we judge the ability of X-ray spectroscopic techniques to identify different regimes of chemical bonding at metal–organic interfaces. To achieve this, we sample different interaction strength regimes in a comprehensive and systematic way by comparing two topological isomers, azulene and naphthalene, adsorbed on three metal substrates with varying reactivity, namely the (111) facets of Ag, Cu, and Pt. Using density functional theory, we simulate core-level binding energies and X-ray absorption spectra of the molecular carbon species. The simulated spectra reveal three distinct characteristics based on the molecule-specific spectral features which we attribute to types of surface chemical bonding with varying strength. We find that weak physisorption only leads to minor changes compared to the gas-phase spectra, weak chemisorption leads to charge transfer and significant spectral changes, and strong chemisorption leads to a loss of the molecule-specific features in the spectra. The classification we provide is aimed at assisting interpretation of experimental X-ray spectra for complex metal–organic interfaces.},

	abstract = {X-ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy play an important role in investigating the structure and electronic structure of materials and surfaces. Ab initio simulations provide crucial support for the interpretation of complex spectra containing overlapping signatures. Approximate core-hole simulation methods based on density functional theory (DFT) such as the delta-self-consistent-field (ΔSCF) method or the transition potential (TP) method are widely used to predict K-shell XPS and NEXAFS signatures of organic molecules, inorganic materials and metal-organic interfaces at reliable accuracy and affordable computational cost. We present the numerical and technical details of our variants of the ΔSCF and TP method (coined ΔIP-TP) to simulate XPS and NEXAFS transitions. Using exemplary molecules in gas-phase, in bulk crystals, and at metal-organic interfaces, we systematically assess how practical simulation choices affect the stability and accuracy of simulations. These include the choice of exchange-correlation functional, basis set, the method of core-hole localization, and the use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC). We particularly focus on the choice of aperiodic or periodic description of systems and how spurious charge effects in periodic calculations affect the simulation outcomes. For the benefit of practitioners in the field, we discuss sensible default choices, limitations of the methods, and future prospects.},

	abstract = {First principles simulation of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is an important tool in the challenging interpretation and assignment of XPS data of metal-organic interfaces. We investigate the origin of the disagreement between XPS simulation and experiment for the azulene molecule adsorbed on Ag(111). We systematically eliminate possible causes for this discrepancy, including errors in the structural model and finite size effects in periodic boundary conditions. By analysis of the electronic structure in the ground-state and the core-hole excited-state, we are able to trace the error back to artificial charge transfer between adsorbed molecule and metal surface. This is caused by the self-interaction error of common exchange-correlation functionals. This error is not remedied by standard hybrid or range-separated hybrid functionals. We employ an ad hoc self-interaction error correction based on molecular orbital projection, that exposes this issue and is able to recover the correct experimental behaviour. The charge transfer artefact also negatively affects the prediction of X-ray absorption spectra for this system. Both the simulated photoemisson and x-ray absorption spectra show a better agreement with experimental data, once the ad hoc correction is employed. Similar core-hole-induced charge artefacts may affect core-level simulations at metal-organic interfaces more generally.},

	abstract = {Molecules adsorbed onto metal surfaces, especially carbon-based aromatic molecules, can provide systems that offer tunable properties and can be used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). It is important to understand the behaviour of these systems at a molecular level in order to rationally engineer interfaces with specific properties. Core-level spectroscopy can provide a beneficial method to probe aspects of molecule-metal interfaces such as geometrical structure, stability, chemical bonding and electronic structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy can be used in tandem to gain significant insight into the studied system. However, the resulting spectra from these techniques can often prove hard to fully analyse as they contain multiple close-lying features and loss of clarity from broadening. This is where simulations of spectra can come in to help to disentangle and interpret spectra. This thesis establishes practical simulation workflows to predict XPS and NEXAFS spectra of metal-organic interfaces based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). These methods are applied to study the adsorption of aromatic adsorbates on metal surfaces, two-dimensional networks, and an oxidised diamond surface. As part of this work, the assessment of the performance and accuracy of simulations against experiment was carried out. Core-level simulations on various systems were performed to rationalise experimental findings on structure, stability, and surface chemical bonding.},

	abstract = {Diamond-based materials have unique properties that are exploited in many electrochemical, optical, thermal, and quantum applications. When grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the growth rate of the (110) face is typically much faster than the other two dominant crystallographic orientations, (111) and (100). As such, achieving sufficiently large-area and high-quality (110)-oriented crystals is challenging and typically requires post-growth processing of the surface. Whilst CVD growth confers hydrogen terminations on the diamond surface, the majority of post-growth processing procedures render the surface oxygen-terminated, which in turn impacts the surface properties of the material. Here, we determine the oxygenation state of the (110) surface using a combination of density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. We show that in the 0–1000 K temperature range, the phase diagram of the (110) surface is dominated by a highly stable phase of coexisting and adjacent carbonyl and ether groups, while the stability of peroxide groups increases at low temperatures and high pressures. We propose a mechanism for the formation of the hybrid carbonyl-ether phase and rationalize its high stability. We further corroborate our findings by comparing simulated core-level binding energies with experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data on the highest-quality (110)-oriented diamond crystal surface reported to date.},

	abstract = {The performance of graphene-based (opto)electronic devices depends critically on the graphene/metal interface formed at the metal contacts. We show here that the interface properties may be controlled by topological defects, such as the pentagon–heptagon (5–7) pairs, because of their strongly enhanced bonding to the metal. To measure the bond energy and other key properties not accessible for the embedded defects, we use azulene as a molecular model for the 5–7 defect. Comparison to its isomer naphthalene, which represents the regular graphene structure, reveals that azulene interacts more strongly with a Pt(111) surface. Its adsorption energy, as measured by single-crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC), exceeds that of naphthalene by up to 116 kJ/mol (or up to 50\%). Both isomers undergo hybridization of their frontier orbitals with metal states, as indicated by X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy combined with molecular orbital (MO) projection analysis through dispersion-corrected, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on the NEXAFS/DFT analysis, the stronger bond of the 5–7 system is attributed to the different energetic response of its unoccupied frontier orbitals to adsorption. Adsorption-induced bond-length changes show substantial topology-related differences between the isomers. Electron transfer occurs in both directions through donation/back-donation, resulting in the partial occupation (deoccupation) of formerly unoccupied (occupied) orbitals, as revealed by periodic energy decomposition analysis (pEDA) for extended systems. Our model study shows that the topology of the π-electron system strongly affects its bonding to a transition metal and thus can be utilized to tailor interface properties.},

	abstract = {Interfaces between polycyclic π-electron systems and metals play prominent roles in organic or graphene-based (opto)electronic devices, in which performance-related parameters depend critically on the properties of metal/semiconductor contacts. Here, we explore how the topology of the π-electron system influences the bonding and the electronic properties of the interface. We use azulene as a model for nonalternant pentagon–heptagon (5–7) ring pairs and compare it to its isomer naphthalene, which represents the alternant 6–6 ring pair. Their coverage-dependent interaction with Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces was studied with the normal-incidence X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, UV and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (UPS and XPS), and density functional theory (DFT). Coverage-dependent adsorption heights and spectroscopic data reveal that azulene forms shorter interfacial bonds than naphthalene and engages in stronger electronic interactions with both surfaces. These differences are more pronounced on Cu. Increasing coverages lead to larger adsorption heights, indicating bond weakening by intermolecular repulsion. The extensive DFT calculations include dispersive interactions using (1) the DFT-D3 scheme, (2) the vdWsurf correction based on DFT-TS, (3) a many-body dispersion (MBD) correction scheme, and (4) the D3surf scheme. All methods predict the adsorption heights reasonably well with an average error below 0.1 Å. The stronger bond of azulene is attributed to its nonalternant topology, which results in a reduced highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap and brings the LUMO energetically close to the Fermi energy of the metal, causing stronger hybridization with electronic states of the metal surfaces.},

	abstract = {Pyrene derivatives play a prominent role in organic electronic devices, including field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. The flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the central π-electron system on the relevant properties such as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a π-electron system with non-alternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy. The non-alternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions. The concept of aromaticity is used to interpret the major topology-related differences.},

A prominent case is the topological defects in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. The performance of graphene-based (opto-)electronic devices depends critically on the properties of the graphene/metal interfaces at the contacting electrodes. The question of how these interface properties depend on the ubiquitous topological defects in graphene is of high practical relevance, but could not be answered so far. Here, we focus on the prototypical Stone–Wales (S–W) topological defect and combine theoretical analysis with experimental investigations of molecular model systems. We show that the embedded defects undergo enhanced bonding and electron transfer with a copper surface, compared to regular graphene. These findings are experimentally corroborated using molecular models, where azupyrene mimics the S–W defect, while its isomer pyrene represents the ideal graphene structure. Experimental interaction energies, electronic-structure analysis, and adsorption distance differences confirm the defect-controlled bonding quantitatively. Our study reveals the important role of defects for the electronic coupling at graphene/metal interfaces and suggests that topological defect engineering can be used for performance control.},
